## What you can do

* Replay session recordings in our web player
* Capture all of the user interactions and find ones you can about in the Events manager
* Set your own custom analytics event and do complex funnels/queries in the dashboard
* Collect referrer value and source of installation per visitor

## Reporting issues

For more information on how to report issues please check our [Smartlook SDK Support section](https://smartlook.github.io/docs/sdk/support/#how-to-submit-an-issue).

## Project build

In case you want to use SDK in Android project add these lines to your gradle project file:

```android
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/release"
    }
  }
}
```

Also add this line to your module gradle: `implementation('com.smartlook.recording:app:0.9.0.2.5.3-beta')`

## API Reference

Applications can interact with the SDK using public SDK methods.

### Initialize Smartlook

You must supply your **Smartlook SDK key** which can be acquired in the Smartlook Dashboard.

Basic init method is `Smartlook.init(YOUR_API_KEY)` This method initializes the SDK **and starts the recording.** Best place to call this method is Application class or any entry point to your app.

In case you need to init SDK after i.e. fetching your API key or in the middle of the activity lifecycle, feel free to use `Smartlook.initIrregular(YOUR_API_KEY, currentActivity)` version of init method. Keep in mind that this init method **starts the recording as well.**

In case you want to init the SDK and you want to handle start of the recording by yourself, use `Smartlook.initPassive(YOUR_API_KEY)` For more information about manual start or pause of the recording, see **On demand pause and start** section.

Apart from above mentioned methods you can also use extended versions to **set custom FPS for recording**, i.e. `Smartlook.init(YOUR_API_KEY, FPS)` 

In case you are using TextureView, you can try different init method: `Smartlook.init(YOUR_API_KEY, true)` It has some experimental features as **TextureView/Maps/MapBox** recording etc.

Currently we support API 18+ for recording.

### Mark sensitive views

Use: `markViewAsSensitive(View view)`

You can mark sensitive views to be hidden from recordings. EditTexts and Webviews are hidden by default. In case you are using Webview for rendering of non-sensitive information, feel free to temporary allow their recording: `enableWebviewRecording(boolean enable)`

### Recording marking

Developer can also mark session with some internal key that is associated to the user via `identify(@NonNull String userId)` method or more detailed method `identify(@NonNull String userId, final JSONObject userProperties)`.

### On demand pause and start

In case you want to pause recording, feel free to call `Smartlook.pause()`. Once user is somewhere else where recording makes sense to you, call `Smartlook.start()`.

## Analytics

SDK provides several methods for analytics. First one is `track(@NonNull String eventName)` which is very simple event without any props. Second one is `track(@NonNull String eventName, JSONObject eventProperties)` with additional data which can be used in funnels or any additional filtering.

Next method is `timeEvent(@NonNull String eventName)`. It is not sending any event, but once developer calls any `track(...)` method with corresponding eventName, it will also add extra duration property. This might be usefull for developers to measure any time sensitive or long running actions in the app.

Our SDK also supports super props. Those can be set by `setGlobalProperties(JSONObject eventProperties)` method. Such props are added to any event sent from the client in the future. Properties in global scope has higher priority so in merging process those from global scope will override custom props with the same key.

Developer can also use `setGlobalImmutableProperties(JSONObject eventProperties)` method. Once property is set, it cannot be changed. This can be helpful i.e. in cases when we want to set something only once and be sure we will never touch that again. Immutable props are superior to the custom and normal global ones -> will override same keys.

Methods accepting `JSONObject` also exists in alternative form accepting `Bundle` object.

In case developer wants to remove any global props they can do that by `removeSuperPropertyByKey(String propertyKey)` or `removeAllSuperProperties()` methods. Any global property is stored until app is uninstalled.


## Crash reporting

In case developer did not handle any exception SDK will automatically report stackTrace - basically last action in the session. This works our of box and is sent to our servers in case analytics/errors is applicable.

Because app process is killed by the crash video is going to be rendered and sent to the server once new session is started.

Proguard mapping file still not available -> Beta functionality.


## Crashlytics

In case you are using Crashlytics in your project, once Fabric setup is done, you can call `enableCrashlytics(boolean enable)` method and we will do our best to add extra information directly to your crash report.

![New key-value pair](https://sdk.smartlook.com/android/docs/crash_docs_pair.png)

In Crashlytics dashboard, there should be new `SMARTLOOK SESSION URL` key-value pair with link to your Smartlook dashboard. Once opened, you can directly play recording just before mentioned crash by Crashlytics.
